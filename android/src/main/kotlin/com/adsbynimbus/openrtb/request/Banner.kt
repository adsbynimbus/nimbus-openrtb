/**
 * This object represents the most general type of impression. Although the term "banner" may have very
 * specific meaning in other contexts, here it can be many things including a simple static image, an
 * expandable ad unit, or even in-banner video (refer to [Video] for generalized and full featured video
 * ad units). An array of [Banner] objects can also appear within the [Video] to describe optional
 * companion ads defined in the VAST specification. The presence of a [Banner] as a subordinate of the
 * [Impression] object indicates that this impression is offered as a banner type impression. At the publisherâ€™s
 * discretion, that same impression may also be offered as video, audio, and/or native by also including as
 * [Impression] subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one
 * of the offered types.
