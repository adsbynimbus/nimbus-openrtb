# How to contribute

## Adding platforms
1) Create or checkout a branch named platform/{platform-name}
2) Commit code and open a Pull Request to master
3) Squash and merge into master
4) Delete branch platform/{platform-name}

## Working on platform updates
1) Create a branch named {platform-name}/{feature-name}
2) Commit code and open a Pull Request to platform/{platform-name}
3) Squash and merge into platform/{platform-name}
4) Delete branch {platform-name}/{feature-name}

This branching methodology allow for simultaneous work contributing to different platform while maintaining high code quality through code reviews
