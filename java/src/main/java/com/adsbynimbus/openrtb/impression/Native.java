/**
 * This class represents a native type impression.
 *
 * Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook
 * post). As such, the response must be well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
 * The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the Dynamic Native Ads API. It
 * defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad units. This object provides the means of
 * transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the
 * auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads API. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that
 * specification. The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is
 * offered as a native type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as
 * banner, video, and/or audio by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid
 * for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
 *
