/**
 * This object represents the most general type of impression. Although the term "banner" may have very
 * specific meaning in other contexts, here it can be many things including a simple static image, an
 * expandable ad unit, or even in-banner video (refer to the Video object in Section 3.2.7 for the more
 * generalized and full featured video ad units). An array of Banner objects can also appear within the
 * Video to describe optional companion ads defined in the VAST specification.
 * The presence of a Banner as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as
 * a banner type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as
 * video, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However, any
 * given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
