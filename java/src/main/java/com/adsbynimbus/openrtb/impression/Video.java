/**
 * This object represents an in-stream video impression. Many of the fields are non-essential for minimally viable
 * transactions, but are included to offer fine control when needed. Video in OpenRTB generally assumes compliance with
 * the VAST standard. As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by optionally including an array of
 * {@link Banner} objects that define these companion ads. The presence of a {@link Video} as a subordinate of the
 * {@link Impression} object indicates that this impression is offered as a video type impression. At the publisherâ€™s
 * discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp
 * subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered
 * types.
