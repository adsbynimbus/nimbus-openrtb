/**
 * This object represents an in-stream video impression. Many of the fields are non-essential for minimally
 * viable transactions, but are included to offer fine control when needed. Video in OpenRTB generally
 * assumes compliance with the VAST standard. As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by
 * optionally including an array of Banner objects (refer to the Banner object in Section 3.2.6) that define
 * these companion ads.
 * The presence of a Video as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a
 * video type impression. At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as
 * banner, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types. However,
 * any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
